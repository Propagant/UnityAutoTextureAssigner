### How to use the Texture Auto Assigner?
*The Texture Auto Assigner is specially made for Standard Shader models only!* Open the main window in **Window/Texture Auto Assigner**. Set up the specific asset path for directory containing target materials you want to use for assign. Set up the second path (doesn't have to be specific) for directory that contain textures for selected materials. Both textures and materials must have the **same name**, at least the textures must contain the material name. Additionally you can add *'naming macro'* which is nice for differing albedo or metallic maps... Example: I'm going to assign just Albedo maps. My albedo texture name is 'texture_AlbedoTransparency'. So my naming macro would be '_AlbedoTransparency'. The material name should be at least 'texture'.
